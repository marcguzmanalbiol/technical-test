            There are several differences, but I think that the most relevant one is that a class can have functions
            attached to it, called methods. A struct can not have it.

            Once more, there are several differences. For example, an array has fixed size (once we initialise it,
            it cannot be resized) but a vector is dynamic (its length increase when pushing elements inside). Moreover,
            vector is <em>NOT</em> index based.

            It is similar to malloc or calloc, it is a request for memory allocation.

            There exists a design pattern called <em>singleton</em> which is based on restricting the creation of a
            class to one unique object (that is, a singleton. In mathematics, a singleton is a set containing only one
            element, so this definition mimics the classical one).

            To divide a <em>big</em> task into <em>smaller</em> ones, each of them treating different data but
            performing the same operation on it. For example, there exists parallel algorithms for matrix
            multiplication, this increase its speed almost x NUM_OF_CORES of our machine.

            A thread is a segment of a process. Moreover, a process tends to be isolated, whereas threads share memory.

            Using IPC (Inter Process Communication), which is a mechanism of an operating system to allow the processes
            to manage shared data.

            A deadlock is a condition where a program cannot access a resource it need to continue. A race condition
            occurs when two or more threads can access shared data an they try to change it at the same time, resulting
            in a undefined behaviour of the process.

            <em>git fetch</em> downloads the data from a remote repository but do not apply them to our local one.
            <em>git pull</em>, instead, do that task.
        </p>
