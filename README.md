# Intstructions of the compilation
The project have been done in C++20. In order to compile, it is mandatory to use the flag --pthread. If you use CLion, you can use CMakeList to do a quick setup. 
It shouldn't be difficult to set up. Python project don't need any external library, I think that the one used it already installed in Python3.8, the one used 
in the project.
